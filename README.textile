h1. Socky

Due to high interest in implementations of Socky in other languages and frameworks Socky gem is changing name from "socky" to "socky-server". Expect soon to see "socky-client" gem for ruby and separate one for framoworks like Rails.

From today this is only transitional package. Please change install socky-server gem and remove this one.

You can find new repository "here":http://github.com/socky/socky-server-ruby
